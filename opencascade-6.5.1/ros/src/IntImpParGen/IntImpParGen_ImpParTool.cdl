generic class ImpParTool from IntImpParGen (
        ImpTool      as any; -- as ImpTool from IntImpParGen
	ParCurve     as any;
	ParTool      as any) -- as ParTool from IntImpParGen(ParCurve) 

inherits FunctionWithDerivative from math

        ---Purpose: Implements the function  used by FunctionAllRoots
        --          to find  the areas where  the distance between the
        --          implicit and the parametric curves  is less than a
        --          tolerance.
