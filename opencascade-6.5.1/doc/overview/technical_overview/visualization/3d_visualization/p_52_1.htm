<p class=ReleaseNotes-1>Application Interactive Services (AIS)</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Application Interactive 
 Services provide the means to create links between an application GUI 
 viewer and the packages which are used to manage selection and presentation. 
 The tools <font style="font-weight: bold;">AIS</font> defined in order 
 to do this include different sorts of entities: both the selectable viewable 
 objects themselves and the context and attribute managers to define their 
 selection and display.</p>

<p class="whs1">To orient the user 
 as he works in a modeling environment, views and selections must be comprehensible. 
 There must be several different sorts of selectable and viewable object 
 defined. These must also be interactive, that is, connecting graphic representation 
 and the underlying reference geometry. These entities are called Interactive 
 Objects, and are divided into four types:</p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs3"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family='Times: New Roman;"><font size=1 style="font-size:8pt;">&nbsp;</font></span>the 
 Datum</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs3"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family='Times: New Roman;"><font size=1 style="font-size:8pt;">&nbsp;</font></span>the 
 Relation</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs3"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family='Times: New Roman;"><font size=1 style="font-size:8pt;">&nbsp;</font></span>the 
 Object</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs3"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family='Times: New Roman;"><font size=1 style="font-size:8pt;">&nbsp;</font></span>None.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs1">The Datum groups together 
 the construction elements such as lines, circles, points, trihedrons, 
 plane trihedrons, planes and axes.</p>

<p class="whs1">The Relation is made 
 up of constraints on one or more interactive shapes and the corresponding 
 reference geometry. For example, you might want to constrain two edges 
 in a parallel relation. This constraint is considered as an object in 
 its own right, and is shown as a sensitive primitive. This takes the graphic 
 form of a perpendicular arrow marked with the <font style="font-style: italic;">||</font> 
 symbol and lying between the two edges.</p>

<p class="whs1">The Object type includes 
 topological shapes, and connections between shapes.</p>

<p class="whs1"><font style="font-style: italic;">None</font>, 
 in order not to eliminate the object, tells the application to look further 
 until it finds an object definition in its generation which is accepted.</p>

<p class="whs1">Inside these categories, 
 you have the possibility of<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family='Times: New Roman;"><font size=1 style="font-size:8pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>an 
 additional characterization by means of a signature. The signature provides 
 an index to the further characterization. By default, the<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family='Times: New Roman;"><font size=1 style="font-size:8pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>Interactive 
 Object has a <font style="font-style: italic;">None</font> type and a 
 signature of <font style="font-style: italic;">0</font> (equivalent to 
 <font style="font-style: italic;">None</font>.) If you want to give a 
 particular type and signature to your interactive object, you must redefine 
 the two virtual methods: <font style="font-weight: bold;">Type</font> 
 and <font style="font-weight: bold;">Signature</font>.</p>

<p class="whs1">In the C++ inheritance 
 structure of the package, each class representing a specific Interactive 
 Object inherits <font style="font-weight: bold;">AIS_InteractiveObject</font>. 
 Among these inheriting classes, <font style="font-weight: bold;">AIS_Relation</font> 
 functions as the abstract mother class for inheriting classes defining 
 display of specific relational constraints and types of dimension. Some 
 of these include:</p>

<p class="whs3">-<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family='Times: New Roman;"><font size=1 style="font-size:8pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>display 
 of constraints based on relations of symmetry, tangency, parallelism and 
 concentricity</p>

<p class="whs3">-<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family='Times: New Roman;"><font size=1 style="font-size:8pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>display 
 of dimensions for angles, offsets, diameters, radii and chamfers.</p>

<p class="whs3">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">No viewer can show 
 everything at once with any coherence or clarity. Views must be managed 
 carefully both sequentially and at any given instant. Another function 
 of the view is that of a context to carry out design in. The design changes 
 are applied to the objects in the view and then extended to the underlying 
 reference geometry by a solver. To make sense of this complicated visual 
 data, several display and selection tools are required. To facilitate 
 management, each object and each construction element has a selection 
 priority. There are also means to modify the default priority.</p>

<p class="whs1">To define an environment 
 of dynamic detection, you can use standard filter classes or create your 
 own. A filter questions the owner of the sensitive primitive in local 
 context to determine if it has the desired qualities. If it answers positively, 
 it is kept. If not, it is rejected.</p>

<p class="whs1">The standard filters 
 supplied in AIS include:</p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs2">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs3">AIS_AttributeFilter</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs3">AIS_SignatureFilter</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs3">AIS_TypeFilter.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs1">Only the type filter 
 can be used in the default operating mode, the neutral point. The others 
 can only be used in open local contexts.</p>

<p class="whs1">Neutral point and local 
 context constitute the two operating modes of the central entity which 
 pilots visualizations and selections, the Interactive Context. It is linked 
 to a main viewer and if you like, a trash bin viewer as well.</p>

<p class="whs1">The neutral point, 
 which is the default mode, allows you to easily visualize and select interactive 
 objects which have been loaded into the context. Opening local contexts 
 allows you to prepare and use a temporary selection environment without 
 disturbing the neutral point. A set of functions allows you to choose 
 the interactive objects which you want to act on, the selection modes 
 which you want to activate, and the temporary visualizations which you 
 will execute. When the operation is finished, you close the current local 
 context and return to the state in which you were before opening it (neutral 
 point or previous local context).</p>

<p class="whs1">An interactive object 
 can have a certain number of graphic attributes which are specific to 
 it, such as visualization mode, color, and material. By the same token, 
 the interactive context has a set of graphic attributes, the Drawer which 
 is valid by default for the objects it controls.<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family='Times: New Roman;"><font size=1 style="font-size:8pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span>When 
 an interactive object is visualized, the required graphic attributes are 
 first taken from the object's own Drawer if one exists, or from the context 
 drawer for the others.</p>
