<p>Visualization in Open CASCADE Technology is based on the separation 
 of modeling data you want to display and select, and on the graphical 
 presentation of that data structure.</p>
<p>For visualizing data structures, OCCT provides ready-to-use algorithms, 
 which create graphic presentations from geometric models. These data structures 
 may be used with the viewers supplied, and can be customized to take the 
 specificity of your application into account.</p>
<p>Displaying is managed through presentation services, and selection in 
 its turn is managed through selection services. With these services, data 
 structures and algorithms are provided to display objects of an application, 
 and to support graphical selection of these objects.</p>
<p>Application Interactive Services (AIS) are provided to manage displaying, 
 detection and selection of graphical presentations.</p>
<p>These services associate data structures and interactive objects.</p>

<h2 class="whs7">Services Common to 2D and 3D </h2>

<p>This is a set of libraries providing data structures and interfaces 
 common to both 2D and 3D and processed by the 2D and 3D viewers respectively.</p>

<h2 class="whs7">3D Graphics &amp; Visualization</h2>

<h2 class="whs8">3D Graphics</h2>

<p>3D Graphics (<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><I><B>Graphic3d</B></I></span> 
 package) supports three-dimensional manipulation of graphic primitives 
 such as polylines, planar polygons with or without holes, text, and markers 
 by controlling attributes such as color, transparency, reflection, line 
 type, line width, and text font. These primitives can be displayed, zoomed, 
 panned and rotated in a 3D viewer.</p>

<p>It runs on OpenGL graphic library for all platforms. Text is rendered 
 in 3D with help of texture-mapped fonts implementation provided by FTGL 
 library. It is possible to use any True Type font installed in the system 
 for text output, </p>

<p>Most types of primitives supported by Graphic3d can be dumped to a vector 
 file format such as PDF and PostScript. Export to vector formats is implemented 
 with help of GL2PS library.</p>

<h2 class="whs8">3D Visualization</h2>

<p>This library provides services for:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li style="font-size: 8pt;"
		class=kadov-p><p class="whs9">Selection of 3D 
 data structures </p></li>
	
	<li style="font-size: 8pt;"
		class=kadov-p><p class="whs9">Presentation of 
 3D data structures </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Access to 3D presentation and selection is provided through AIS (Application 
 Interactive Services). This package is a high-level interface that offers 
 access to the lower-level presentation and selection services. AIS expand 
 this underlying functionality with standard 3D selection attributes, presentation 
 management, and standard 3D presentation attributes, and manages it in 
 the definition of GUI viewers. To implement these services, AIS package 
 includes the following:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li style="font-size: 8pt;"
		class=kadov-p><p class="whs9">Interactive context 
 </p></li>
	
	<li style="font-size: 8pt;"
		class=kadov-p><p class="whs9">Interactive objects 
 </p></li>
	
	<li style="font-size: 8pt;"
		class=kadov-p><p class="whs9">A graphic attributes 
 manager </p></li>
	
	<li style="font-size: 8pt;"
		class=kadov-p><p class="whs9">Selection filters 
 </p></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="whs10">The Interactive Context</h2>

<p>The interactive context pilots 3D visualizations and selections. The 
 interactive context allows you to manage, in a transparent way, graphic 
 and &quot;selectable&quot; behavior of interactive objects which is not 
 yet defined in the predefined types of these objects.</p>

<p>AIS have two operating context types. The default neutral point type 
 allows you to easily visualize and select entire interactive objects, 
 which have been loaded into the context. Opening a local context allows 
 you to prepare and use a temporary selection environment to select a part 
 of an interactive object.</p>

<h3 class="whs11">Interactive Objects</h3>

<p>Entities which are visualized and selected in the AIS viewer are objects. 
 They connect the underlying reference geometry of a model to its graphic 
 representation in AIS. You can use predefined OCCT classes of standard 
 interactive objects for which all necessary functions have already been 
 programmed, or, in case you are an advanced user, you can implement your 
 own classes of interactive objects.</p>

<h3 class="whs11">Graphic Attributes 
 Manager</h3>

<p>Graphic attributes manager, or AIS Drawer, stores graphic attributes 
 for specific interactive objects and for interactive objects controlled 
 by interactive context.</p>

<p>Initially, all drawer’s attributes are filled out with the predefined 
 values which will define the default 3D object appearance.</p>

<p class="whs1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>When an interactive object is visualized, the required graphic attributes 
 are first taken from its own drawer if one exists, or from the context 
 drawer if no specific drawer for that type of object exists.</p>

<h3 class="whs11">Selection Filters</h3>

<p>An important aspect in selection is the filtering of entities you to 
 select. Selection filters allow you to refine the dynamic detection context, 
 which you want to put into effect. Some of these filters can be used at 
 the Neutral Point, others in an open local context only. You can also 
 program your own filters and load them into the context.</p>

<h2 class="whs7">2D Graphics &amp; Visualization</h2>

<p class="whs12"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 12pt;"><font size=3 style="font-size:12pt;"><B>2D 
 Graphics</B></font></span></p>

<p>2D Graphics (<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><I><B>Graphic2d</B></I></span> 
 package) is based on native services provided by the underlying window 
 system (Win32 GDI under Windows, Xlib API under Unix and Linux), unlike 
 OpenGL-based 3D Graphics.</p>

<p>It supports two-dimensional manipulation of graphic primitives such 
 as straight lines, segments, polylines, curves, text, and markers by controlling 
 attributes such as color, line type, line width, and text font. These 
 primitives can be displayed, zoomed, panned, and rotated in a 2D viewer.</p>

<p>Plotter output is provided in PostScript, HPGL2, and CGM. Importation 
 of bitmap images from xwd, gif, and bmp format is also supported.</p>

<p class="whs13">Note that in 2D, Open 
 CASCADE provides full internationalization. Text in Chinese and Japanese 
 characters can be input and printed in plotter output.</p>

<p class="whs12">2D Visualization</p>

<p>This library provides services for:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li style="font-size: 8pt;"
		class=kadov-p><p class="whs9">Presentation of 
 2D data structures </p></li>
	
	<li style="font-size: 8pt;"
		class=kadov-p><p class="whs9">Selection of 2D 
 data structures </p></li>
</ul>

<p>2D presentation is handled by presentation algorithms, which compute 
 and display a graphic data structure from a shape. You can also write 
 your own presentation algorithms. In OCCT, display services are separated 
 from the data they represent. This separation allows you to modify a geometric 
 or topological model without modifying the services by means of which 
 it is displayed.</p>

<p>The concept of selection consists in defining 2D bounding boxes capable 
 to return an owner of any object presentation found within them. When 
 an owner is found, presentation of a shape is highlighted according to 
 display attributes for the shapes of that type. 2D selection is supported 
 by an internal algorithm which allows selection of an object when the 
 mouse cursor is positioned on that object.</p>
