<p class=ReleaseNotes-1>When is it necessary to use a handle?</p>

<p>When designing an object, the user is faced with the choice of manipulating 
 that object by value, or by handle. The criterion for choosing one solution 
 or the other is the following:</p>

<p>Is your object one which may have a long life-time within the application 
 and to which you want to make multiple references?</p>

<p>In this case, unquestionably the choice is to manipulate this object 
 with a handle. The memory for the object will be allocated on the heap. 
 The handle which points to that memory is a light object which can be 
 rapidly passed in argument. This avoids the penalty of copying a large 
 object. On the other hand, is your object one which will have a limited 
 lifetime, for example, a object limited to the scope of a single algorithm? 
 In this case, independent of the size of the object, the choice is clearly 
 to manipulate this object by value. The Reason being that this object 
 is allocated on the stack and the allocation and de-allocation of memory 
 is extremely rapid - avoiding the implicit calls to 'new' and 'delete' 
 occasioned by allocation on the heap.</p>

<p>In the case of an object which, you are certain, will only be created 
 once during the lifetime of an application and which will exist throughout 
 that lifetime, then the best choice may be a class manipulated by handle 
 or value which you will declare as a global variable. </p>
