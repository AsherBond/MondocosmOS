
PRE-REQUISITES:
---------------

 This version of Wok requires at least Tcl 8.0.
 (In the following we assume you have downloaded this tarball in /home/me)


 The section A) and B) explain how to install Wok and getting started.
 The section C) explains how you can use this version of Wok to access
 previous version of OpenCascade.

A) First installation Unix/Linux systems.
-----------------------------------------

 This section assumes that you have never installed WOK on your system. Performing the
 four following steps will install WOK and create a minimal environment for working.

 1. From the current directory where you have downloaded , move to the sub-directory
    site. 
    % cd /home/me/wok-CXX/site

 2. Copy from this directory the file tclshrc_Wok in your home directory with name
     .tclshrc or .wishrc depending on the shell you want to use.

 3. Insert in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH the location where the wok shareable have been downloaded
    that is in our case:
    /home/me/wok-CXX/lib/lin if your are on Linux
    /home/me/wok-CXX/lib/sun if your are on SunOS

 4. Start tclsh or wish.  You can then create new wok entities.


B) First installation on WindowsNT.
-----------------------------------

 We suppose that you have downloaded the zip archive for WOK in directory W:\wok-CXX

    1. Open a MS-DOS command console and set the current directory as follow
    
      W:> cd wok-CXX\site

    2. Copy from this directory the file tclshrc_Wok in the directory pointed to by the variable 
       HOME if any. If this variable is not setted, set it to a location and copy the file tclshrc_Wok 
       in there. The final name must be tclshrc.tcl or wishrc.tcl depending on the shell you want to
       use.
       

    3. Insert in the PATH variable the location where Wok dll resides that is :
       wok-CXX\lib\wnt

    4. Start tclsh or wish.

C) Accessing previous OpenCascade workbenches.
---------------------------------------------

    By default , all the required initialisations are done in the tcl init file. One of them consist to
    set the location where Wok will find or created entities. This location is pointed to by the environment 
    variable ( or MS Dos variable ) named WOK_ROOTADMDIR. If you want to address previous Wok workbenches 
    (say those created with the C3.1 version) set the variable WOK_ROOTADMDIR to this place. 
    Note: The directory pointed to by WOK_ROOTADMDIR contains at least 3 files. ATLIST, DEFAULT.edl, SESSION.edl.
