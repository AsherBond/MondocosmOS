COLLADAMax is a new implementation of a 3ds Max plug-in to export a Max scene or 
parts of it to a COLLADA file, released under an MIT-license. 
In contrast to other existing 3ds Max to COLLADA exporters, this new plug-in does not store the
COLLADA document in an intermidiate data model but writes it directly to file. This leads to a dramatic 
reduction of memory consumption and to much a better performance.


For installation instructions please read the "INSTALL" file.
