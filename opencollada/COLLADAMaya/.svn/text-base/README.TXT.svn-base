COLLADAMaya is a new implementation of a Autodesk Maya plug-in to export a 
Maya scene or parts of it to a COLLADA file, released under the MIT-license. 

This plug-in does not store the COLLADA document in an intermidiate data 
model, it writes the data directly into file. This results in reduction of 
memory consumption and better performance.

For installation instructions please read the "INSTALL" file.
