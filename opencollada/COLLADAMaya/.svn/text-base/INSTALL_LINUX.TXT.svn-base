Requirements:
-------------
To run the COLLADAMaya plug-in, you need a version of Autodesk Maya installed.

Supported versions are:
Autodesk Maya 2009

Install:
--------

NOTE: The "YOUR_MAYA_PATH" used in the following section depends on your Maya 
version. Following environment variables to your Maya location are supported:
- MAYA_PATH2009

You have to copy following files:
- The COLLADAMaya.so file to your personal Maya plug-in directory. 
	($YOUR_MAYA_PATH)/plug-ins 
- The openColladaExporterOpts.mel file to your Maya scripts directory. 
	($YOUR_MAYA_PATH)/scripts 
- the openColladaImporterOpts.mel file to your Maya scripts directory. 
	($YOUR_MAYA_PATH)/scripts 

You can also define a environment variable "MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH" and put the 
so-file into the refered directory. Autodesk Maya will load the plug-ins 
from this directory too.

Execute:
--------
When you start Autodesk Maya, go to the menu 
	Window > Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager
and load the plug-in "COLLADAMaya.so" from the extended list.
Now you can export your maya scene into a COLLADA file.

Maya plugin loader bug:
-----------------------
Maya error: "Failed to find COLLADA exporter"
It's a known bug that sometimes in some maya versions maya don't recognoize the
last converter on the list. To fix this, load a extra plug-in after the fact 
and it should work.
