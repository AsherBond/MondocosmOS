Requirements:
-------------
To build the COLLADAMaya plug-in, you need following installations:
-	Autodesk Maya, including the SDK
- 	Boost C++ libraries

Supported versions of Autodesk Maya are:
-	Autodesk Maya 2008
-	Autodesk Maya 2009
-	Autodesk Maya 2010

Supported and tested versions of boost c++ libraries:
-	Boost 1.35
-	Boost 1.36

You can download the latest version of boost from:
http://www.boost.org/users/download/

You also need a c++ compiler. The Project was build and tested with: 
-	For Windows: Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 and the VC2005 Platform SDK. 
	You find the MVS solution file in ~project_dir/COLLADAMaya/COLLADAMaya.sln, 
	respectively the MVS project file in 
	~project_dir/COLLADAMaya/scripts/COLLADAMaya.vcproj
- 	For OSMac: XCode 
	You can find the XCode project file in 
	~project_dir/COLLADAMaya/COLLADAMaya.xcodeproj

The project's build is tested for: win32, x64, mac.

Build:
------
Before you start to build, you have to define following environment 
variables for a win32, respectively a x64 system: 

NOTE: The "YOUR_MAYA_PATH" used in the following section depends on your Maya 
version. Following environment variables to your Maya location are supported:
- MAYA_PATH2010
- MAYA_PATH2010_X64
- MAYA_PATH2009
- MAYA_PATH2009_X64
- MAYA_PATH2008
- MAYA_PATH2008_X64

win32:
-	"YOUR_MAYA_PATH" to your installation path of Autodesk Maya.
	The include directory of maya has to be "$(YOUR_MAYA_PATH)\include".
	The lib directory of maya has to be "$(YOUR_MAYA_PATH)\lib".
-	The "BOOST_ROOT" environment variable has to be the path to your 
	installation path of boost.
-	The "BOOST_LIB_PATH" environment variable has to be the path to your 
	lib directory of boost.
	
x64:
-	"MAYA_PATH2008_X64" to your installation path of Autodesk Maya.
	The include directory of maya has to be "$(YOUR_MAYA_PATH)\include".
	The lib directory of maya has to be "$(YOUR_MAYA_PATH)\lib".
-	The "BOOST_ROOT" environment variable has to be the path to your 
	installation path of boost.
-	The "BOOST_LIB64_PATH" environment variable has to be the path to your 
	lib directory of boost.

Download and compile the sources of COLLADAMaya from
http://code.google.com/p/opencollada/source/checkout

Open the solution in ~project_dir/COLLADAMaya/COLLADAMaya.sln
The solution configurations 
- ReleasePlugin2010
- DebugPlugin2010
- ReleasePlugin2009
- DebugPlugin2009
- ReleasePlugin2008
- DebugPlugin2008
will create a dynamic library called "COLLADAMaya.mll". The file 
will be created in the output folder and copied into the folder 
$(YOUR_MAYA_PATH)/bin/plug-ins of your Autodesk Maya installation.
If you don't use the MS Visual Studio project file, you have to copy the 
created "COLLADAMaya.mll" file into this directory.

The solution configuration "ReleaseConsole2008" and "DebugConsole2008" create
the "COLLADAMaya.exe" file in the output folder and will be copied into the
"./OpenCOLLADA/COLLADAMaya/testsuite" folder. If you start the "testAllFiles.bat",
all maya files in the current directory and all sub-directories will be 
converted to collada "dae" files and checked with the coherency checker.

For help on installation, please read the INSTALL_WIN.TXT file.
