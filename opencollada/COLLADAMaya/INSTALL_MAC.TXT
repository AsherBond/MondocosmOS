Requirements:
-------------
To run the COLLADAMaya plug-in, you need a version of Autodesk Maya installed.

Supported versions are:
Autodesk Maya 2010
Autodesk Maya 2009
Autodesk Maya 2008

For help on build, please read the BUILD file.

Install:
--------
On build with XCode, the required plugin files will be copied into 
your Autodesk Maya directories.

NOTE: The "YOUR_MAYA_PATH" used in the following section depends on your Maya 
version. Following environment variables to your Maya location are supported:
- MAYA_PATH2010
- MAYA_PATH2009
- MAYA_PATH2008

You have to copy following files:
- ~project_dir/COLLADAMaya/build/Debug/COLLADAMaya.bundle to your personal
	Maya plug-in directory. The default directory on OSMac is 
	/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/2010/plug-ins respectively
	/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/2009/plug-ins respectively
	/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/2008/plug-ins
- ~project_dir/COLLADAMaya/scripts/openColladaExporterOpts.mel to your 
	personal Maya scripts directory. The default directory on OSMac is 
	/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/2010/scripts respectively
	/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/2009/scripts respectively
	/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/2008/scripts 
- ~project_dir/COLLADAMaya/scripts/openColladaImporterOpts.mel to your 
	personal Maya scripts directory. The default directory on OSMac is 
	/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/2010/scripts respectively
	/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/2009/scripts respectively
	/Users/Shared/Autodesk/maya/2008/scripts 

You can also define a environment variable "MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH" and put the 
mll-file into the refered directory. Autodesk Maya will load the plug-ins 
from this directory too.

Execute:
--------
When you start Autodesk Maya, go to the menu 
	Window > Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager
and load the plug-in "COLLADAMaya.bundle" from the extended list.
Now you can export your maya scene into a COLLADA file.

Maya plugin loader bug:
-----------------------
Maya error: "Failed to find COLLADA exporter"
It's a known bug that sometimes in some maya versions maya don't recognoize the
last converter on the list. To fix this, load a extra plug-in after the fact 
and it should work.
