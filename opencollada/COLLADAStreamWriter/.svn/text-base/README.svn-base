COLLADAStreamWriter is to export data into a COLLADA file, released under the 
MIT-license. 

This library does not store the COLLADA document in an intermidiate data 
model, it writes the data directly into file. This results in reduction of 
memory consumption and better performance.

For installation instructions please read the "INSTALL" file.
