OGR_FD_GetFieldDefn(OGRFeatureDefnH hDefn, int iField)

Fetch field definition of the passed feature definition.

This function is the same as the C++ method
OGRFeatureDefn::GetFieldDefn().

Starting with GDAL 1.7.0, this method will also issue an error if the
index is not valid.

Parameters:
-----------

hDefn:  handle to the feature definition to get the field definition
from.

iField:  the field to fetch, between 0 and GetFieldCount()-1.

an handle to an internal field definition object or NULL if invalid
index. This object should not be modified or freed by the application.

OGR_FD_AddFieldDefn(OGRFeatureDefnH hDefn, OGRFieldDefnH hNewField)

Add a new field definition to the passed feature definition.

This function should only be called while there are no OGRFeature
objects in existance based on this OGRFeatureDefn. The OGRFieldDefn
passed in is copied, and remains the responsibility of the caller.

This function is the same as the C++ method
OGRFeatureDefn::AddFieldDefn.

Parameters:

%feature("docstring")  SetGeomType "void
OGR_FD_SetGeomType(OGRFeatureDefnH hDefn, OGRwkbGeometryType eType)

Assign the base geometry type for the passed layer (the same as the
feature definition).

All geometry objects using this type must be of the defined type or a
derived type. The default upon creation is wkbUnknown which allows for
any geometry type. The geometry type should generally not be changed
after any OGRFeatures have been created against this definition.
