  Provides the data (or model) portion of the client side cells. The view is
  handles by the other classes, for example jme renderers are in org.jdesktop.wonderland.client.jme.cellrenderer
  
  Cells can be extended either by subclassing (which provides for static extension) or
  by the use of CellComponents which allow dynamic addition (and removal) of
  cell capabilities.
  
  One important CellComponent is the MovableComponent which provides the infrasture
  which allows cells to move around the world. The component handles all communication
  and provides listeners etc for movement updates.
