          This section describes the operation of various important processes on
          on the server. Some of the classes described here are not in the 
          public API but the information is included here for those who would
          like a broader overview of Wonderland.

      <h2>User Login</h2>
      <p>
        The user login steps are
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li>
                Connection established
                WonderlandBoot.loggedIn called, this creates a default
                protocolSessionListener
            </li>
            <li>
               The protocolSessionListener will wait for a valid protocol
               to be established and then create a wrapped listener to process
               messages.
            </li>
            <li>
               Once a valid protocol is established the protocolSessionListener
               calls UserManager.loggedIn to log in the user. A record of the 
               session and protocol is stored in the UserMO
           </li>
           </ul>
      </p>
  </body>
