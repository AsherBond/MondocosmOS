    MT Hot locking strategy
    <p>
      Any modification to a graph requires that a lock is obtained
      and help on the root of the graph for the duration of the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a graph changes the spaces it intersects then the spaces
      must be locked, being careful to avoid deadlock
