      Cells provide spatialised geometry, behavior and network support for world content.
  <p>
      Each Cell in the world has a local bounds defined by the developer. The local bounds
      must encapsulate all the geometry for that cell, if the geometry changes size
      or position then it may be necessary to update the bounds of the cell. The developer is 
      responsible for ensuring that the local bounds always encapsulates the geometry.
      Cell bounds are defined in Cell local coordinates. The local bounds do not have
      to encapsulate the bounds of the cells children.
  </p>
  <p>
      The bounds of a cell can overlap the bounds of it's sibling cells.
  </p>
  
  <p>
      Cells include the concept of liveness. A live cell is one that is 
      attached (possibly indirectly) to a RootCellMO. Some CellMO method calls
      only return valid results for live cells, for non live cells they throw
      IllegalStateException. The RootCellMO is created and managed by
      CellManagerMO.
  </p>
  
  <p>
      The functionality of cells can be changed by adding CellComponentMO to a 
      cell. For example all cells are static (in that there origin or bounds can
      not be changed) unless they have  MovableComponentMO in their component list.
      This allows features to be dynamically added and removed from cells which is
      not possible using subclassing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
      Spaces - 
        A live Cell is always in at least one space
        Space origin and bounds are immutable (need to special case movable spaces)
