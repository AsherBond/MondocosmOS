Quick guide to the MM3D code.

Directories:
   src -- All source code
      libmm3d -- Low-level 3D functionality, model/texture handling
      mm3dcore -- Core application code
      depui -- Custom UI widgets for 3D drawing, used by many UI elements
      qtui -- User interface files (Qt's .ui files)
      implui -- Code that implements the user interface functionality
      commands -- Geometry menu commands
      tools -- Toolbar tools
      pixmap -- Icons used by mm3d
   doc -- Online documentation, HTML format
   i18n -- Internationalization files
   man -- Manpage
   desktop -- Desktop icons and config files
   util -- Utilities for building
   plugins -- Place-holder for unpacking and building plugins

In general, the most interesting code is in src/libmm3d, src/tools,
and src/commands for model manipulation and src/implui for user interface.
About half of the code is in src/libmm3d, and about half of the code
in src/libmm3d is in the model class (model.h, model.cc, model_*.cc).

You can use src/maketags.sh to make ctags files for the source tree.

Some development options for ./configure:

   --enable-debug=[yes/no/cov]  The yes and no options turn debug information
                                on and off. The cov option turns on debugging
                                and coverage information.
   --enable-profile=[yes/no/core]  The yes and no options turn profiling
                                   information on and off. The core option
                                   turns on profiling just for the application
                                   libraries (not the User Interface).
