Misfit Model 3D requires Qt (3.x) with OpenGL support.  See the INSTALL file
for details on where to get these packages.

This program uses autoconf and automake for building from source.  What this
means is that if you are lucky you can install this program with these
easy steps:

   ./configure
   make
   su [become root]
   make install

Depending on your system configuration, you may have to run "sudo bash"
instead of "su" to get a root shell.  This will build an 'mm3d' executable
and install it in /usr/local/bin.  Documentation will be in
/usr/local/share/doc/mm3d.

On Mac OS X you must run "make mm3d.app" after "make".

For more detailed installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.
See INSTALL.WIN32 for Windows-specific instructions.
