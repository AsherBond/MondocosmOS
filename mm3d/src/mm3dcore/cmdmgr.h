//------------------------------------------------------------------
// About the CommandManager
//------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The CommandManager is a singleton which is responsible for keeping
// track of every command.  Commands are non-interactive operations which
// modify some part of the model, usually operating on selected vertices.
//
// If you create a class derived from the Command class (in command.h)
// and have an object of that class called myCommand, you can regiter that 
// command with the following statement:
//
//   CommandManager::getInstance()->registerCommand( myCommand );
//
// This will add myCommand to the command list and it will be available in
// Misfit's menu system.  Commands which are statically linked to Misfit
// are registered in stdcmd.cc.  Commands which are dynamically added to
// Misfit via plugins can be registered in the plugin_init function of a
// plugin.
//
// See command.h for instructions on creating a class derived from Command.

#include "command.h"
