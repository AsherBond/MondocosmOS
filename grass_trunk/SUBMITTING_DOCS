NOTE: Please improve this list!

Dear (new) GRASS developer,

when submitting documentation to GRASS SVN repository, please take
care of following rules:

[ see SUBMITTING        for C hints ]
[ see SUBMITTING_PYTHON for Python code hints ]


0. Introduction

   There are two types of documentation
   - Libraries programmers docs: we use doxygen and document the functions 
      directly in the source code. See lib/gis/*.c and lib/gis/gislib.dox for examples

   - User manual: we write it in simple HTML, storing the manual in a 
      file '<module>.html' within the subdirectory of the module.
      The file contains no header nor footer. The complete HTML file is
      autogenerated during the compilation process (indeed, it is generated
      in a virtual session directly after compilation of the module).
      In this virtual session the module is called internally with
      --html-description which generates the parameters/flags list in
      HTML format, along with '<module>.html', HTML header and footer
      the final HTML manual page is created and stored in the target
      binaries directory. In a separate process the MAN format is 
      generated from the complete HTML files.

1. Editing of HTML pages
   To avoid insertion of too complicated HTML tags (see also below),
   we strongly suggest to use a plain text editor rather than a
   HTML editor for editing.


2. Module manual page:
   Place the documentation in HTML format into '<module>.html', where
   <module> is the name of the module. E.g. if the module is named
   r.example, the documentation file should be named r.example.html.

   The easiest way to do this is to study an existing HTML page
   (to get the page style, e.g. vector/v.to.db/v.to.db.html).
   With a few exceptions, header and footer are NOT allowed.
   You can add figures (PNG format); the figure name prefix should be the 
   module name. See raster/r.terraflow/r.terraflow.html for an example.

   A number of major sections should be present in each help page.

   * = Required
   ! = Suggested
   . = Optional

   In recommended order
   --------------------

   * <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
   ! <h2>NOTE</H2>, <h2>NOTES</h2>
   ! <h2>EXAMPLE</h2>, <h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
   . <h2>TODO</h2>
   . <h2>BUGS</h2>
   . <h2>REFERENCE</h2>, <h2>REFERENCES</h2>
   * <h2>SEE ALSO</h2>
   * <h2>AUTHOR</h2>, <h2>AUTHORS</h2>

   Note that the parameter information is auto-generated upon
   compilation. This is done by running the module in a virtual session
   after compilation (see the output of 'make'). To subsequently
   verify the final HTML page, check the resulting HTML pages which
   will be stored with the name of the module.

   Examples (please add some) should be coded like this:

   <div class="code"><pre>
   v.to.db map=soils type=area option=area column=area_size unit=h
   </pre></div>
 
   The online WWW man pages is updated every Saturday (from SVN
   repository).


3. Usage of limited HTML tags
   Since the MAN conversion of g.html2man is limited, please use
   no other HTML tags than:
   <a> <b> <blink> <body> <br> <code> <dd> <dl> <dt> <em> 
   <h2> <h3> <h4> <head> <header> <hr> <i> <img> <li> <ol> <p>
   <pre> <sup> <table> <td> <th> <title> <tr> <ul>


4. Suggested HTML markup protocol:
   Module names (i.e., v.category) should be emphsized with <em>,
   and boldface <b> for flags and parameter names. Shell commands, 
   names, values, etc. should use <tt>. Empahsized phrases should use 
   italics <i>. The SEE ALSO section of each page should also be 
   alphabetized. 	  		


5. When submitting new files to the repository set SVN properties,
   e.g. for HTML file
    
       svn:mime-type : text/html
       svn:keywords : Author Date Id
       svn:eol-style : native

   See
   http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.advanced.props.html
