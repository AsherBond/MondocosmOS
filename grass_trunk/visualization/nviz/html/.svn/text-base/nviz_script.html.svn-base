<h2>Scripting</h2>


<h3>NVIZ - Introduction</h3>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The scripting tools are still under developemnt. 
A number of the functions in these menus are not yet fully functional.


<p>The scripting environment lets you develop a one-time script file that 
can handle 
complex changes to the <strong>NVIZ</strong> environment.

<p>Scripting is controlled by the commands provided in the scripting
pulldown menu.  A script
file can be played back in Nviz by using the <em>Play Script</em> option
in the menu.  Scripting can become more powerful,
however, by adding loops around a sequence of script events, or by
using higher-level tools.
