----------------------

Wed May  1 11:07:12 1996  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

	* panel_vect.tcl (add_map): Fixed bug in "add_map" which
	erroneously creates a map even if the user selects "cancel" in the
	map browser.

	* wirecolorPopup.tcl (mkWireColorPopup): Fixed size of color
	buttons and made the window non-resizable.

	* script_file_tools (canvas_scroll_height): Fixed a scrolling bug
	and made the frame and attribute listboxes line up as before.
	Also, the top level window for this tool is only "width" resizable.

Mon Apr  1 11:06:31 1996  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

	* script_file_tools: Set the value of Nv_(APP) to "." so that
	popups are positioned correctly.

	* fileBrowser.tcl (create_file_browser): Changed the positioning
	of the file browser to be based on the window path stored in
	Nv_(APP) (see comment below).

	* nviz: Introduced the global variable Nv_(APP).  This variable
	names the toplevel window for the interface portion of an Nviz
	display.  For example, for nviz Nv_(APP)=.top2.  This value is
	used for positioning various file browser popups.  It is desirable
	to have these popups appear over the interface portion rather than
	randomly since random appearances may overlap with the rendering
	window.

	* script_play: Changed this script so that it sources "config.tcl"
	which contains the standard set of default settings (resources,
	paths, etc).

Tue Mar 26 11:18:50 1996  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

	* script_file_tools: Changed all "-scrollincrement" commands to
	"-xscrollincrement" and "-yscrollincrement" for canvases.  This
	is a change due to tk4.0.  Also, reconfigured the header of this
	file so that it sources config.tcl.

	* script_play: Changed the header so that the new version of
	nvwish is used.

	* script_tools: Changed the header so that the new version of nvwish
	is used.

	* script_file_tools: Changed the header so that the new version of
	nvwish is used.  This was necessary because scripts which rely on
	pre-4.0 version of Tk cannot communicate via "send" with 4.0 and
	later shells.

	* panel_kanimator.tcl (keyanimAddKey): Fixed bug in which the "new
	key time" entry was not padded properly with leading zeros.

	(keyanimPosSlider): Fixed bug in positioning of scrollbars when
	the slider is positioned.  This feature had to be fixed to account
	for the new interface for scrollbar positioning.

	(mkkeyframeArea): Fixed bug in initialization of canvas
	scrollbars.  By default the scrollbars were being initialized to
	use old style region setting, this has been changed so that new
	style is used by default.

Wed Mar 20 14:27:24 1996  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

	* panel_kanimator.tcl (keyanimSpecialHScroll): Scroll bars now
	have a new interface.  Changed the "keyanimSpecialHScroll"
	procedure which handles x scrolling so that it works with the new
	interface.  Also, had to fix a similar problem with
	"keyanimPosSlider".  In addition, I fixed a minor bug in
	"keyanimPosSlider", occasionally tcl would barf on numerical
	expressions like "09".  In this case the leading zero confuses tcl.

	* panel_animation.tcl (mkkeyframeSlider): Fixed the key frames
	slider for the animation panel.  This was done by setting the
	"height" attribute to "12m" when adding the slider as a window to
	the display canvas.

Tue Mar 19 14:34:30 1996  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

	* panel_site.tcl (mksitePanel): changed the sites panel a bit so
	that sensible defaults are used in the case where a newly loaded
	site file has no values for such things as size, width, siteshape,
	etc.

	* colorPopup.tcl (mkColorButtons): changed the size of individual
	color buttons.  Because of the size changes in tk4.0, not all the
	color buttons were being displayed on the color popup.  Also made
	the color popup window non-resizable by default.  Finally, the
	entries for scales were not being updated properly.  This was
	fixed as well.

Mon Mar 11 14:53:34 1996  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

	* config.tcl: Changed the default color setting for Scrollbars to
	account for the the change in resource names.  Specifically,
	-background is now -troughcolor, -foreground is now -background,
	and -activeforeground is now -activebackground.

	* panel_surf.tcl (mkPositionPanel): changed the floatscale slider
	to be "scale" and updated colors to account for tk4.0 changes.

	* panelIndex: the "mkdspf" panel is expected to be obsolete soon
	so I have moved it to ../archive.  See that directory for details.

	* panel_sdiff.tcl (Nv_mksdiffSurfacelist): added the "-tearoff 0"
	option to the menus created by the "sdiff" panel.  Again, we want
	to avoid the possibility of this menu hanging around long after
	the list of surfaces has changed.

	* widgets.tcl (mkMapList): added the "-tearoff 0" option to the
	menus created by mkMapList.  This removes the tearoff entry from
	menus which are used as maplists.  We want to avoid the
	possibility that these menus are hanging around long after the
	list of surfaces has changed.

	* config.tcl: added this file to conform to the same configuration
	that was created for the Grass4.2 release.  Basically, any
	features which need to be shared by Nviz and its child processes
	is put into this file.  This file should be sourced at the
	beginning of each SEPARATE Nviz invoked process.  Eventually I
	will also need to add the "src_boot" variable to the C-code.

	* widgets.tcl (Nv_mkXYScale): in creating the puck for the XYScale
	widget, -fill had to be changed to -outline.  Apparently this is a
	change in canvas functionality for tk4.0.

Thu Mar  7 14:13:54 1996  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

	* multimapBrowser.tcl (multimap_browser_select_mapset): Changed
	entries and listboxes in this file to work with the new interface
	of tk4.0 for these widgets.

	* mapBrowser.tcl (map_browser_select_mapset): Changed entries and
	listboxes in this file to work with the new interface of tk4.0 for
	these widgets.

	* filemapBrowser.tcl (create_filemap_browser): Changed entries and
	listboxes in this file to work with the new interface of tk4.0 for
	these widgets.

	* fileBrowser.tcl (create_file_browser): The interface for entries
	and listboxes has changed slightly.  These changes have been
	accounted for in this file.

	* nviz (Nv_makeGUI): Menus now include a tear-off entry in slot 0
	by default. This means that in general all menu indices will be
	off by one if explicitly referred to.

	* fileBrowser.tcl (create_file_browser): tk_listboxSingleSelect no
	longer exists.  This has been replaced everywhere it is used by
	-selectmode single.

	* panel_kanimator.tcl (mkkeyframeArea): Canvases no longer support
	-scrollincrement.  These have been changed to -xscrollincrement
	and -yscrollincrement.

Wed Mar  6 12:31:52 1996  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

	* attPopup.tcl (create_slideconstant_popup): The -sliderforeground
	option is no longer supported in scales.  Sliderforeground should
	now be replaced by background.  Similarly, background should be
	replaced with troughcolor.  I have done this in all scales.

	* panel_query.tcl (mkqueryPanel): The -activeforeground option is
	no longer supported in scrollbars.  Activeforeground should now be
	replaced by activebackground.  I have done this in all scrollbars.

	* attPopup.tcl (create_slideconstant_popup): The -activeforeground
	option is no longer supported in scales.  Activeforeground should
	now be replaced by activebackground.  I have done this in all scales.

	* widgets.tcl (Nv_mkFloatScale): floatscale was originally a
	custom widget since the old version of tk didn't allow floating
	point values in scales.  Fortunately, the new version of tk
	supports this feature so Nv_mkFloatScale now returns regular old
	scales.  Eventually, this routine should be nuked and Nv_mkScale
	should be made more general.

	* nviz: Added "wm resizable" commands to make the main nviz
	command window unresizable by default.  We may want to change this
	later.  Also, this marks the start of porting the tcl/tk scripts
	up to Tcl7.4/Tk4.0.
	
	(Nv_makeGUI): The menu command "disable" is not supported in
	tk4.0, I have changed these to "entryconfigure /index/ -state
	disabled" 

Tue Nov  14 12:31:52 1995  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

        * nviz: Disabled some menu features which aren't working
	correctly.

Wed Nov  1 12:31:52 1995  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

        * nviz: Added a few new features to allow panels to be disbursed
	more widely.  Users may now define the environment variable
	Nviz_PanelPath which specifies directories to search for panels.
	Each panel directory should have a tclIndex file and a panelIndex
	file.  The tclIndex file is created to allow auto loading.  The
	panelIndex file specifies the names of all panels defined in the
	directory.  This file is used to determine which panels are loaded
	from the given directory.

Thu Sep  21 12:31:52 1995  Mark Astley  <astley@gambit.gis.uiuc.edu (Mark Astley)>

        * nviz: Auto-pathing now used to automatically load needed
        routines.

Wed May 13 17:20:10 CDT 1998  Bill Brown

	* fileBrowse.tcl (create_file_browser): Added last_dir 
	variable so file browsers will come up with the last
	directory written to as default path.
