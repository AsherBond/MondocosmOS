# convert glwrappers.c to conditionally use OGL
# Then go back to ogsf and fix up:
    # gs_set_font
    # gs_put_label
# 


done (font & label weren't working - still need redone for OpenGL anyway)

togl window now opens instead of glxwin.

also need to figure out GLX islinked option & duplicate for togl

# Then ready to start replacing the GL code in ogsf 
# with the OGL code from my OGL3d release
# 

mostly done - enough to try

Now need to work on scripts - make them use togl instead of GLX

Swapbuffers seems to kill it - are we double buffering? check config
of OGL window being used.
