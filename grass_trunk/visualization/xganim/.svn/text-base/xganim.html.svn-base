<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>xganim</em> is a tool for animating a series of GRASS raster
files. At startup, a graphics window is opened containing VCR-like
button controls for: rewind, reverse play, step back, stop, step
forward, forward play, loop, swing, slower, faster, show filenames,
current frame number, and Exit. The image is displayed above or to the
left of the controls. Each raster map is read into memory, then the
animation is played once beginning to end. The user may then replay
the series or play continuous animation by using the buttons.
<p>
The user may define up to four "views", or sub-windows, to animate
simultaneously. e.g., View 1 could be rainfall, View 2 flooded areas,
View 3 damage to bridges or levees, View 4 other economic damage, all
animated as a time series. There is an arbitrary limit of 400 files
per view (400 animation frames), but the practical limit may be less
depending on the window size and amount of available RAM.
<p>
The environment variable XGANIM_SIZE is checked for a value to use as
the dimension, in pixels, of the longest dimension of the animation
window. If XGANIM_SIZE is not set, the animation size defaults to the
rows &amp; columns in the current GRASS region, scaling if necessary
to a default minimum size of 600 and maximum of 900. The resolution of
the current GRASS region is maintained, independent of window size. 
Resizing the window after the program is running will have no effect
on the animation size.
<p>
UNIX - style wild cards may be used with the command line version in
place of a raster map name, but it must be quoted.
<p>
If the number of files differs for each view, the view with the fewest
files will determine the number of frames in the animation.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<div class="code"><pre>
export XGANIM_SIZE=800
xganim view1="rain[1-9]","rain1[0-2]" view2="temp*"
</pre></div>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

For wildcard matching, <em>xganim</em> understands whatever the shell 
understands (as it invokes "ls" via the shell to expand wildcards). 
E.g., a user can use "rast[0-9][0-9]" to match "rast00" through "rast99" inclusive.
If the maps if interest have varying numbers of digits, multiple patterns
can be combined, e.g.:

<div class="code"><pre>
export XGANIM_SIZE=1000
xganim view1=rast[0-9],rast[1-9][0-9]
</pre></div>

to match rast0 through rast99 inclusive.


<h2>BUGS</h2>
On some displays that need to use private colormaps, the interface
buttons may become difficult to see.
