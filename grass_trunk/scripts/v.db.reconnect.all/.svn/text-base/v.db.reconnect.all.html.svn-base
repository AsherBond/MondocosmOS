<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.db.reconnect.all</em> changes database connection of all layers of
all vectors in the current mapset from old_database to database. If a link
does not match the old_database it is left untouched.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The value of the <em>old_database</em> option needs to be the exact
string which appears as the fourth field printed by
<tt>v.db.connect -g</tt>, i.e. with substituted variables.
