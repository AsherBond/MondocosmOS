<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.landsat.rgb</em> auto-balances and enhances the color channels of a
LANDSAT RGB image to provide a more natural color mixture. Only the color
table of each image band is modified, the base data remains untouched.
<p>
The module works by calculating a histogram for each color channel and 
removing an adjustable amount of outliers from either end before recalibrating
the color scale with <em>r.colors</em>.
<p>
It will work with any 8-bit RGB imagery set and the script is easily modified
to work with other datasets of greater band-depth.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Depending on the image, it may or may not be advantageous to use the <b>-p</b>
flag to preserve the relative color scaling. You will have to experiment
with the different options to find a setting that works best for your
particular imagery.
<p>
The <b>strength</b> option should generally be set in the 90-99 range. The
lower the number, the more saturated the image becomes. It represents the
percentage cut-off for the top end of the color histogram curve. The lower
end is fixed at 2% of the area under the curve.
<p>
For quicker execution of this module on large images you can achieve largely
similar results by switching to a coarser resolution before the running of
the module (using <em>g.region</em>) and then back to the original resolution
afterwards.


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

North Carolina sample dataset:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=lsat7_2002_10
i.landsat.rgb blue=lsat7_2002_10 green=lsat7_2002_20 red=lsat7_2002_30
</pre></div>

<h2>TODO</h2>

The <b>strength</b> option requires further refinement.
