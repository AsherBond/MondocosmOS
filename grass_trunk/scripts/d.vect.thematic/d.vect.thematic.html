<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>d.vect.thematic</em> creates thematic maps from vectors of
all types and numeric attributes (stored in the data table connected to a vector
map). Thematic maps can be displayed by either a graduated color scheme (for
all vector types), as graduated icon sizes (for point and centroid types), or
graduated line widths (for lines and boundaries with associated attributes).
The user selects the vector map to be mapped and attribute column from which
to derive mapping intervals, and (optionally) the layer for attribute data.

<p>In thematic maps, the color or point size changes for each range of attribute
values. Value ranges for thematic mapping can be
set at regular intervals, standard deviation units on either
side of the mean, quartiles, or delimited by user-defined breakpoints.
User-defined breakpoints also can  be entered, or piped into d.vect.thematic
from standard input or other external source.

<p>There are options to define the color scheme (graduated
colors) and range of point sizes (graduated points) for thematic maps. A
simple text legend is printed. Optionally, a graphic legend can be drawn in
the selected display monitor. Thematic colors can be uploaded to a GRASSRGB
column for later display,  and thematic map display commands can be saved to a
group file (*.dm) that can be opened, edited, and displayed in
the GIS Manager.

<p>When the psmap option is set to 'name', two psmap instruction files are
created (in the current directory if no path is given), one for the map
('name.psmap') and one for the legend ('name_legend.psmap'). The map file also
contains 'label' commands which allow to create a legend directly in the map by
adding a 'vlegend' command. See the <em><a href="ps.map">ps.map</a></em> man
page for more details.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The algorithm currently uses the <em>v.univar</em> to calculate basic
descriptive statistics needed for thematic mapping (minimum, maximum, mean,
standard deviation, and quartiles).

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Earthquake points with color gradient:

<div class="code"><pre>
d.vect.thematic -l recent_earthquakes column=magnitude type=point
</pre></div>

<p>
Earthquake points with different sizes:

<div class="code"><pre>
d.vect.thematic -l recent_earthquakes column=magnitude type=point \
                themetype=graduated_points maxsize=15
</pre></div>

<p>
Spearfish: differences between 'elevation.10m' and 'elevation.dem':

<div class="code"><pre>
# random sampling of elevation points:
g.region rast=elevation.10m -p
v.random random n=200
v.db.addtable random col="el10 double precision"
# transfer elevations to attribute table of random points map:
v.what.rast random rast=elevation.10m col=elev
v.db.select random

# comparative sampling of second map, incl. differences:
v.sample in=random col=el10 rast=elevation.dem out=elev_sample
v.db.select elev_sample

# thematic map:
d.mon wx0
d.vect.thematic -l elev_sample column=diff type=point
</pre></div>

<p>
North Carolina data set example:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region vect=nc_state
d.vect.thematic -l precip_30ynormals column=annual type=point
</pre></div>
