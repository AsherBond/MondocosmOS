<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net.distance</em> finds the nearast element in set <em>to</em> 
for every element in set <em>from</em>. 

<h2>NOTES</h2>

These two sets are given by the respective <b>layer</b>, <b>where</b> 
and <b>cats</b> parameters. The type of <em>to</em> features is specified 
by <b>to_type</b> parameter and all <em>from</em> features are <em>points</em>. 
A table is linked to <b>output</b> map containing various information 
about the relation. More specifically, the table has three columns: 
<em>cat</em>, <em>tcat</em> and <em>dist</em> storing category of each 
<em>from</em> feature, category of the nearest <em>to</em> feature and 
the distance between them respectively. Furthemore, <b>output</b> map 
contains the shorest path between each <em>cat</em>, <em>tcat</em> pair. 
Each path consist of several lines. If a line is on the shorest path 
from a point then the category of this point is assigned to the line. 
Note that every line may contain more than one category value since a
single line may be on the shortest path for more than one <em>from</em> 
feature. And so the shortest paths can be easily obtained by querying 
lines with corresponding category number.<br>
The costs of arcs in forward and backward direction are specified by 
<b>afcolumn</b> and <b>abcolumn</b> columns respectively. If 
<b>abcolumn</b> is not given, the same cost is used in both directions.  

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
Find shortest path and distance from every school to the nearest hospital 
and show path from school number one.
<div class="code"><pre>
v.net.distance input=city output=nearest from_where="type=school" to_where="type=hospital" afcolumn=SHAPE_LEN
d.vect nearest cats=1
</pre></div>
