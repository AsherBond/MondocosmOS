<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.perturb</em>
reads a vector map of points and writes the same points but
<em>perturbs</em> the eastings and northings by
adding either a uniform or normal delta value. Perturbation means that
a variating spatial deviation is added to the coordinates.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The uniform distribution is always centered about zero.
The associated <em>parameter</em> is constrained to be positive and
specifies the maximum of the distribution; the minimum is
the negation of that parameter. Do perturb into a ring around the
center, the <em>minimum</em> parameter can be used.

<p>

Usually, the mean (first parameter) of the normal
distribution is zero (i.e., the distribution is centered at
zero). The standard deviation (second parameter) is
naturally constrained to be positive.

<p>

Output vector points are not guaranteed to be contained within the
current geographic region.
