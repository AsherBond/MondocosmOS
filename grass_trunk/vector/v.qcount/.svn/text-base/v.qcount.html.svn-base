<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.qcount</em> chooses <b>n</b> circular quadrats of
radius <b>r</b> such that they are completely within the
bounds of the current region and no two quadrats overlap.
The number of points falling within each quadrat are counted
and indices are calculated to estimate the departure of
point locations from complete spatial randomness.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

This program may not work properly with lat-long data. It uses 
<em>hypot()</em>
in two files: <em>count.c</em> and <em>findquads.c</em>.
