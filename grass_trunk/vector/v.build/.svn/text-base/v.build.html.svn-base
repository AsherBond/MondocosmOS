<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.build</em> builds support files for (binary)
GRASS vector data files.  These support files supply
topology and category information that are needed by other
GRASS modules.
<p>
GRASS is generating these support files automatically,
only in rare cases the user has to (re)build them.
<p>
Refer to
<em><a href="vectorintro.html">Vector data processing in GRASS GIS</a></em>
for more information on GRASS GIS vector data model.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<em>v.build</em> creates support files only for binary
vector maps located in the user's current mapset. If vector map 
is located in another mapset, you need to specify this:

<p>
<div class="code"><pre>
v.build map=geology@PERMANENT
</pre></div>

<p>
In case of errors, the user can optionally generate an <em>error</em>
vector map containing the erroneous vectors for later inspection.
