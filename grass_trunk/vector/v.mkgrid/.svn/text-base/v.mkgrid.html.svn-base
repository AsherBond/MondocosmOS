<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.mkgrid</em> will create a vector map representation of a regular coordinate grid.
Both point and area vector grids can be created.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

Grid points created with the <b>-p</b> flag will be placed at the
<i>center</i> of each grid cell, not at the grid line nodes.
<p>
This is NOT to be used to generate a vector map of USGS quadrangles,
because USGS quads are not exact rectangles.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Make a 4x3 grid, cells 20km a side, with lower left corner at 2716500,6447000:
<div class="code"><pre>
v.mkgrid map=coro_grid grid=4,3 position=coor coor=2716500,6447000 box=20000,20000
</pre></div>
<br>

<p>
Make a 10x12 lat/lon grid, cells 2 arc-min a side, with lower left corner
at 167deg 52min east, 47deg 6min south. For use with e.g. QGIS you can then
pull this grid into a projected location with <em>v.proj</em> before
exporting as a Shapefile with <em>v.out.ogr</em> (within GRASS you could
just use <em>d.grid -w</em> from the projected location for the same effect).
<div class="code"><pre>
v.mkgrid map=p2min_grid grid=10,12 position=coor coor=167:52E,47:06S box=0:02,0:02
</pre></div>
