<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.lidar.edgedetection</em> is the first of three steps to filter
LiDAR data. The filter aims to recognize and extract attached and 
detached object (such as buildings, bridges, power lines,  trees, etc.) 
in order to create a Digital Terrain Model. 
<br>
<br>
In particular, this module detects the edge of each single feature over 
the terrain surface of a LIDAR point surface. First of all, a bilinear 
spline interpolation with a Tychonov regularization parameter is 
performed. The gradient is minimized and the low Tychonov regularization 
parameter brings the interpolated functions as close as possible to the 
observations. Bicubic spline interpolation with Tychonov regularization 
is then performed. However, now the curvature is minimized and the 
regularization parameter is set to a high value. For each point, an 
interpolated value is computed from the bicubic surface and an interpolated 
gradient is computed from the bilinear surface. At each point the gradient 
magnitude and the direction of the edge vector are calculated, and the 
residual between interpolated and observed values is computed. Two thresholds 
are defined on the gradient, a high threshold <b>tgh</b> and a low one 
<b>tgl</b>. For each point, if the gradient magnitude is greater than or 
equal to the high threshold and its residual is greater than or equal to 
zero, it is labeled as an EDGE point. Similarly a point is labeled as 
being an EDGE point if the gradient magnitude is greater than or equal to 
the low threshold, its residual is greater than or equal to zero, and the 
gradient to two of eight neighboring points is greater than the high 
threshold. Other points are classified as TERRAIN.
<br>
<br>
The output will be a vector map in which points has been classified as 
TERRAIN, EDGE or UNKNOWN. This vector map should be the input of 
<em>v.lidar.growing</em> module.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

In this module, an external table will be created which will be useful for 
the next module of the procedure of LiDAR data filtering. In this table 
the interpolated height values of each point will be recorded. Also points 
in the output vector map will be classified as:
<br>
<br>
TERRAIN (cat = 1, layer = 1)
<br>
EDGE (cat = 2, layer = 1)
<br>
UNKNOWN (cat = 3, layer = 1)
<br>
The final result of the whole procedure (v.lidar.edgedetection,
v.lidar.growing, v.lidar.correction) will be a point classification in
four categories:
<br>
<br>
TERRAIN SINGLE PULSE (cat = 1, layer = 2)
<br>
TERRAIN DOUBLE PULSE (cat = 2, layer = 2)
<br>
OBJECT SINGLE PULSE (cat = 3, layer = 2)
<br>
OBJECT DOUBLE PULSE (cat = 4, layer = 2)
