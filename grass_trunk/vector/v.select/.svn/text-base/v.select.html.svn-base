<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.select</em> allows the user to select features from a vector 
map by features from another one.

<p>
Supported operators (without GEOS):
<ul>
  <li><tt>overlap</tt> - features partially or completely overlap
</ul>

Supported operators (with GEOS):
<ul>
  <li><tt>equals</tt> - features are spatially equals</li>
  <li><tt>disjoint</tt> - features do not spatially intersect</li>
  <li><tt>intersects</tt> - features spatially intersect</li>
  <li><tt>touches</tt> - features spatially touches</li>
  <li><tt>crosses</tt> - features spatially crosses</li>
  <li><tt>within</tt> - feature A is completely inside feature B</li>
  <li><tt>contains</tt> - feature B is completely inside feature A</li>
  <li><tt>overlaps</tt> - features spatially overlap</li>
  <li><tt>relate</tt> - feature A is spatially related to feature B</li>
</ul>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Only features with category numbers will be considered. If required
the <a href="v.category.html">v.category</a> module can be used to add
them. Typically boundaries do not need to be given a category number,
as an area's attributes are inherited from the centroid. Typically
points, lines, and centroids will always want to have a cat number.

<p>
E.g. take a road which separates two farms. It is ambiguous as to which
farm an attribute that is attached to the road belongs to. The boundary
only needs a cat number if it will hold its own attributes, such as road
name or pavement form. A centroid in each paddock holds the information
with respect to ownership, area, etc.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Extract forest fire points from larger fire vector map:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.select ainput=fire binput=forest output=forest_fire operator=overlap
</pre></div>

Extract Italian rivers from VMAP0 watercourses map:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.select ainput=watrcrsl_eurnasia_wgs84 binput=italy_area \
         output=watrcrsl_italy operator=overlap
</pre></div>

<h2>TODO</h2>
 
Processing areas with GEOS is currently incredibly slow. Significant
speed-up is required.
