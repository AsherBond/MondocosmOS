<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.net</em> is used for network preparation and maintenance. 
It permits to insert missing nodes or arcs and to connect unconnected 
nodes to the network within a given distance threshold. 
It can also report the current network graph status. 

<p>
In terms of network analysis, a network consists of nodes connected by 
arcs. In a vector map prepared for network analysis, nodes are represented 
by the grass-internal geometry type <em>node</em> and arcs by the geometry 
type <em>line</em>. If a <em>line</em> consists of several vertices and 
segments (the typical case), only its staring and ending vertex are 
regarded as network nodes. Further more, explicit starting and ending 
nodes for e.g. a least costly path search or subnetwork allocation are 
represented by the geometry type point.

<p>
In general, network analysis will find the least costly (shortest or 
fastest) path from point A to point B by follwing the existing lines. 
This implies that these points must lie at the start or end point of a 
line with is part of the network. If no line is starting or ending at a 
given point, this point is not part of the network, i.e. the point is 
unconnected and unreachable.

<h3>NOTES</h3>

If vector editing is required to modify the
graph, <em><a href="wxGUI.Vector_Digitizing_Tool.html">wxGUI vector
digitizer</a></em> or <em><a href="v.edit.html">v.edit</a></em> can be
used. Separately,
<a href="lrs.html">Linear Referencing System</a> is available in
GRASS.

<h3>EXAMPLES</h3>

<a href="http://www.grassbook.org/data_menu3rd.php">NC dataset</a> based examples.

<p>
Create nodes globally for all line ends and intersections:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.net input=streams output=streams_node operation=nodes
</pre></div>

Merge in nodes from a separate map within given threshold:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.net input=streams points=firestations out=streems_net operation=connect thresh=500
</pre></div>

For generating network for given vector point map is required input file in format

<div class="code"><pre>
[category of edge] [category of start node] [category of end node]
</pre></div>

<div class="code"><pre>
v.net points=geodetic_swwake_pts output=geodetic_swwake_pts_net operation=arcs file=- << EOF
> 1 28000 28005
> 2 27945 27958
> 3 27886 27897
> EOF
</pre></div>
