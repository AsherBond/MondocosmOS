<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.segment</em> generates segments or points from input lines and from
positions read from a text file or '<tt>stdin</tt>'.

<p>
The format is:
<div class="code"><pre>
P &lt;point id&gt;   &lt;line cat&gt; &lt;offset&gt; [&lt;side offset&gt;]
L &lt;segment id&gt; &lt;line cat&gt; &lt;start offset&gt; &lt;end offset&gt; [&lt;side offset&gt;]
</pre></div>

<h3>EXAMPLE</h3>

The user could send to <tt>stdin</tt> something like:
<div class="code"><pre>
P 1 356 24.56
P 2 495 12.31
...
</pre></div>
(pipe or redirect from file into the command).<br>


<h2>NOTES</h2>

A segment is only created for the first line found of the specified category.
<p>
Points are generated along the lines at the given distance(s) from the
beginning of the vector line.
<p>
The side offset is the orthogonal distance from the line. Positive side
offsets are to the right side of the line going forward, negative offsets
are to the left (<em>d.vect</em> with <em>display=shape,dir</em> shows
the direction of vector lines). As the segment distance is measured along the
original line, side-offset lines will be longer than the start-end segment distance
for outside corners of curving lines, and shorter for inside corners.
<p>
All offsets are measured in map units (see "<em>g.proj -p</em>").
<p>
To place a point in the middle of a line, the <em>v.to.db</em> module may be
used to find the line's length. Then half of that distance can be used as the
along-line offset.


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Spearfish location:

<div class="code"><pre>
# extract lines from railroad map:
v.extract railroads out=myrr list=1

# join segments into polyline and reassign category numbers
v.build.polylines myrr out=myrr_pol
v.category myrr_pol out=myrailroads option=add

# zoom to an area of interest
g.region n=4928200 s=4921100 w=605600 e=613200

# show line, category, direction (to find the beginning)
d.vect myrailroads disp=shape,cat,dir lsize=12

# extract line segment from 400m to 5000m from beginning of line 1
echo "L 1 1 400 5000" | v.segment myrailroads out=myrailroads_segl
d.erase
d.vect myrailroads
d.vect myrailroads_segl col=green width=2

# set node at 5000m from beginning of line 1

# get points from a text file

# offset 500m to the left of the tracks.

P 3 1 5000
P 4 1 7000

</pre></div>


<h2>BUGS</h2>
There is a problem with side-offset parallel line generation for inside corners.
<!-- in Vect_line_parallel(), v.parallel is also affected -->
