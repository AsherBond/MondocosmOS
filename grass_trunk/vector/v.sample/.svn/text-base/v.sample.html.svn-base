<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.sample</em> samples a GRASS raster map at the point
locations in the input file by either cubic convolution
interpolation, bilinear interpolation, or nearest neighbor
sampling (default).

<p>

This program may be especially useful when sampling for
cross validation of interpolations whose output is a raster
map.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The output points will have the easting and northing of the input points.
The input category value is used. The input attribute, raster value 
and difference is written to output.

<p>
When NULL values are encountered for a cell, zero value is used
instead.  In these cases, more acurrate results may be obtained
by using the default nearest neighbor comparisons.

<p>

This program may not work properly with lat-long data when
the <b>-BC</b> flags are used.

<p>

When interpolation is done (i.e., the <b>-BC</b> flags are
used), values are assumed to be located at the centroid of
grid cells.  Therefore, current resolution settings are
important.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Comparison of "elevation.dem" and "elevation.10m" Spearfish maps
at random places:

<div class="code"><pre>
#generate random points:
 v.random output=random n=100
#add table with one column:
 v.db.addtable random col="el10 double"
#transfer elevations at random points into table:
 v.what.rast rast=elevation.10m vect=random col=el10
#verify:
 v.db.select random

#generate sampling from other elevation map:
 v.sample in=random col=el10 rast=elevation.dem out=elev_sample

#verify:
 v.db.select elev_sample

#univariate statistics of differences between elevation maps:
 v.univar elev_sample col=diff type=point
</pre></div>
