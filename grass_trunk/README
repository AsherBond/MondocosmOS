How to get write access here?

Write access is only granted to developers who agree to abide by
RFC2 - Legal aspects of code contributions
http://grass.osgeo.org/programming7/rfc/rfc2_psc.html
and the code submission guidelines (file SUBMITTING in this 
directory).

This needs to be communicated to a GRASS developer. S/he will 
then possibly propose you to the GRASS Project Steering committee
after a period of evaluation. For details, see
http://grass.osgeo.org/programming7/rfc/

Once write access is granted, you, the new developer need to
obtain an "osgeo_id" at http://www.osgeo.org/osgeo_userid
If you already have an "osgeo_id" but forgot it, search for it at
Search at http://www.osgeo.org/cgi-bin/ldap_web_search.py

How to compile GRASS:
   See INSTALL file.

Yes, you should really read INSTALL.

How to generate the 'Programmer's Manual':

This needs doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org) and optionally
Graphviz dot (http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/).

To build the GRASS programmer's documentation, run
   make htmldocs
or to generate documentation as single html file (recommended for simple reading)
   make htmldocs-single
here. This takes quite some time. The result is in lib/html/index.html
which refers to further document repositories in
   lib/vector/html/index.html
   lib/db/html/index.html
   lib/gis/html/index.html

The master file is: ./grassrefman.dox where all sub-documents have to
be linked into.

To generate the documents in PDF format, run
   make pdfdocs
