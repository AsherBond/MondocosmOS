<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.random.cells</em> generates a random sets of cells that are at
least <b>distance</b> apart. The cells are numbered from 1 to the
numbers of cells generated. Random cells will not be generated in
areas masked off.

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>output</b></dt>
<dd>Random cells. Each random cell has a unique non-zero cell value
ranging from 1 to the number of cells generated. The heuristic for
this algorithm is to randomly pick cells until there are no cells
outside of the chosen cell's buffer of radius <b>distance</b>.</dd>

<dt><b>distance</b></dt>
<dd>Determines the minimum distance the centers of the random cells
will be apart.</dd>

<dt><b>seed</b></dt>
<dd>Specifies the random seed that
<em>r.random.cells</em> will use to generate the cells. If the random seed
is not given,<em> r.random.cells</em> will get a seed from the process ID
number.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The original purpose for this program was to generate independent
random samples of cells in a study area. The <b>distance</b> value is
the amount of spatial autocorrelation for the map being studied. 

<!-- The amount of spatial autocorrelation can be determined by
using <em>r.2Dcorrelogram</em> with
<em>r.2Dto1D</em>, or <em>r.1Dcorrelogram</em>. With <b>distance</b> set to
zero, the <b>output</b> map will number each non-masked cell from 1 to the
number of non-masked cells in the study region. -->

GRASS (4.1 and beyond) develop uncertainty models of spatial data. I hope
you find it useful and dependable. The following papers might clarify their
