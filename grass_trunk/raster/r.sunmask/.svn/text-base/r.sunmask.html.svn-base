<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.sunmask</em> creates an output map layer based on an input elevation
raster map layer and the sun position. The output map layer contains the
cast shadow areas arising from sun shine and elevations. The user can define
the sun position either directly or the module calculates it from given
location and date/time parameters using the
<a href="http://rredc.nrel.gov/">NREL</a> sun position algorithm. So either
"A:"-parameters to specify the exact known sun position or "B:-parameters"
to specify date/time for sun position calculation by r.sunmask itself have
to be used.

<p>
The module performs sunset/sunrise checks and refraction correction for sun
position calculation. Local coordinate systems are internally transformed to
latitude/longitude for the SOLPOS algorithm. The elevation is not considered
in the sunset/sunrise calculations.

<h2>Notes</h2>

r.sunmask and daylight savings: Rather than convert time to GMT, the solpos
algorithm uses what is called Local Standard Time, which is generally
defined politically as an offset from GMT.  So the key is the offset from
GMT, which the solpos Time Zone parameter.  If the user specifies clock time
(different for winter and summer), he/she would have to change the Time Zone
parameter seasonally in r.sunmask (timezone parameter).
<p>

Note: In latitude/longitude locations the position coordinates pair
(east/west) has to be specified in decimal degree (not D:M:S). If
not specified, the map center's coordinates will be used.
Also <em>g.region -l</em> displays the map center's coordinates.

<p>
Note for module usage with <em>-g</em> flag and calculations
close to sunset/sunrise:

<pre>
 [...]
 sunangleabovehorizont=0.434240
 sunrise=07:59:19
 sunset=16:25:17
 Time (07:59:02) is before sunrise (07:59:19)!
 WARNING: Nothing to calculate. Please verify settings.
 No map calculation requested. Finished.
</pre>

In above calculation appears to be a mistake as
the program indicates that we are before sunrise while
the <i>sun angle above horizon</i> is already positive.
The reason is that <i>sun angle above horizon</i> is
calculated with correction for atmosphere refraction while
<i>sunrise</i> and <i>sunset</i> are calculated <b>without</b>
correction for atmosphere refraction. The output without 
<em>-g</em> flag contains related indications.
