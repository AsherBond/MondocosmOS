<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.report</em> allows the user to set up a series of report parameters to
be applied to a raster map layer, and creates a report.  If invoked with
command line arguments, the report will print out to the screen only.
However, output may be redirected to a file or another program using the
UNIX redirection mechanism. If invoked without command line arguments, the
user is given the option of printing out each report and/or saving output to
a file.

<p>
The report itself consists of two parts, a header section and the main body
of the report.

<p>
The header section of the report identifies the raster map layer(s) (by map
layer name and TITLE), location, mapset, report date, and the region of
interest. The area of interest is described in two parts: the user's current
geographic region is presented, and the mask is presented (if any is used).

<p>
The main body of the report consists of from one to three tables which
present the statistics for each category and the totals for each unit
column.

<p>
Note that, unlike <em><a href="r.stats.html">r.stats</a></em>,
<em>r.report</em> allows the user to select the specific units of measure in
which statistics will be reported.

<p>
Following is the result of a <em>r.report</em> run on the raster map layer
<em>geology</em> (located in the Spearfish, SD sample data base), with the
units expressed in square miles and acres. Here, <em>r.report</em> output is
directed into the file <em>report.file</em>.

<h2>EXAMPLE:</h2>
<dl>
<dd>
<b>r.report map=</b><em>geology</em> <b>units=</b><em>miles,acres</em> &gt; <em>report.file </em>
</dl>

<h2>NOTES</h2>
If the user runs <em>r.report</em> interactively and saves the report output
in a file, this file will be placed into the user's current working
directory.

<p>
If the user runs <em>r.report</em> non-interactively, report output can be
saved by redirecting it to a file or a printer using the UNIX redirection
mechanism.
