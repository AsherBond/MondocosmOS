<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.li.setup</em>  creates and shows configuration files for the 
others r.li programs. For a general introduction, see 
<a href="r.li.html">r.li</a>.
<br>
The configurations are raster map independent, 
it means that you can use a file created on a raster map for analyze any 
other you have. <br>
The program is completly interactive and uses a GUI to help you 
in your choices.

<h3>Analysis methods</h3>

Definition of region for analysis:
<ul>
<li> Whole maplayer: entire map (current region),
<li> Keyboard setting: based on keyboard selection for region definition,
<li> Draw the sampling frame: based on interactive region selection via mouse.
</ul>

Definition of creation of sampling area:
<ul>
<li> Whole maplayer: use entire area selected above,
<li> Regions: select one to many subareas via mouse,
<li> Sample units: automated selection of sampling area (for details see below)
<ul>
  <li> Random nonoverlapping,
  <li> Systematic contiguous,
  <li> Systematic noncontiguous,
  <li> Stratified random,
  <li> Centered over sites (vector points).
</ul>
<li> Moving window: rectagular or circular with size
<li> Select areas from the overlayed vector map (for details see below)
</ul>

<h3>Usage details</h3>

The startup window shows your configuration files, you can: 
<ol>
<li><em><b>Load a file</b></em>: the configuration is printed using 
rectangles with differents colors (green for the raster map, 
red for the sample 
frame and blue for the sample areas), and other notes (disposition of 
sample areas etc).
The configuration file is saved in <tt>~/.grass7/r.li/my_conf</tt>.
<!-- NOT REALLY CLEAR: -->
Configuration output files are raster if moving window disposition was
selected, otherwise they are in ~/.r.li/output folder.
<br> 
All dimension are percentage of raster rows or columns.
<li><em><b>Create a new file:</b></em> this create a new configuration 
file in an interactive way, in three steps
     <ol> 
     <li> Choose file name and maps to use for setting:
          <ul>
	  <li> <em>Configuration file name </em>(required): the name
	  of new configuration file
	  <li> <em>Raster map name</em> (required): the name of raster
	  map to use for setting
	  <li> <em>Vector map to overlay</em> (optional): name of a vector 
	  map to overlay in setting
	  <li> <em>Site file to overlay</em> (optional): name of vector map 
	  of points type to overlay in setting
	  </ul>
     <li> Set the sampling frame. The sample frame is a rectangular area 
     which contains all the areas to analyze. It can be defined in three 
     ways: 
          <ul>
	  <li><em>Whole map layer</em>: the sample frame is the whole map
	  <li><em>Keyboard setting</em>: the user enters the coordinates in
	  cells of upper left corner of sampling frame and its length in
	  rows and columns
	  <li><em>Draw the sample frame</em>: the user draws the sample frame
	  on map using mouse.
	  </ul>
     <li> Set the sample areas. The sample areas are simply the areas to 
     analyze. They can be defined in five ways (see the picture below):
          <ul>
	  <li><em>Whole map layer</em>: the sample area is the whole sample 
	  frame
	  <li><em>Regions</em>: the user enters the number of areas and then 
	  draws them using mouse. 
	  <li><em>Sample units</em>: they are areas of rectangular or circular 
	  shape. The user can define them using keyboard or mouse.
	      <ul>
	      <li>keyboard: the user define the shape of sample unists and 
	      their disposition: 
	          <ul>
		  <li><em>Random non overlapping</em>: the user specifies 
		  the number of sample units and they are placed in a 
		  random way at runtime. It is guaranted that the 
		  areas do not intersect themselfs.
		  <li><em>Systematic contiguous</em>: the defined sample
		  is placed covering the sample frame, side by side 
		  across rows.
		  <li><em>Systematic non contiguous</em>: the same as above, 
		  but here ever rectangle is spaced from another by
		  a specified number of cells
		  <li><em>Stratified random</em>: the sample frame is
		  divided in n strats of rows and m strats of columns 
		  (n and m are given by user), then the specified 
		  number of sample areas are placed in a random way, 
		  one for every m*n areas defined by strats.
		  <li><em>Centered over sites</em>: the sample areas
		  are placed into sample frame centering them on points 
		  in site file. 
		  </ul>
	      <li>mouse: the user chooses the shape and then draws the 
	      specified number of sample areas on map.
	      </ul>
	    </ul>
	 <li><em>Moving Window:</em> the user defines a rectangular or 
	 circular area, it is moved over all the raster increasing only
	 of a cell for every move(in columns if possible, if not in rows). 
	 It produces a new raster containing the result of all analysis.
	 <li><em>Select areas from the overlayed vector map</em>: 
	 the sample areas are defined by the vector map selected above.
	 For every cat in vector map, the procedure prompts the 
	 user if he wants to include it as sample area.
	 The resulting configuration file can be used only with the 
	 specified raster map, and the procedure can be used only if
	 whole map layer is selected as sampling frame.
   </ol>
<li><em><b>Remove a file</b></em> the selected file is deleted from the
available configuration files.
<li><em><b>Help</b></em>: open this help text.
<li><em><b>Close</b></em> module window.
</ol>

<h2>NOTES</h2>
Configuration files are raster map independent because areas are saved using 
relative coordinates.
