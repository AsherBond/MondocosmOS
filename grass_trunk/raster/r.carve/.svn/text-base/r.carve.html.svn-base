<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.carve</em> accepts vector stream data as input, transforms them to
raster, and subtracts a defaultdepth+additionaldepth from a DEM. If
the given width is more than 1 cell, it will carve the stream with the
given width. With the -n flag it should eliminate all flat cells within
the stream, so when and if the water gets into the stream it will
flow. The <em>points</em> option generates x,y,z for points which define the stream
with the z-value of the bottom of the carved-in stream. These points
can then be combined with contours to interpolate a new DEM with
better representation of valleys.

<h2>NOTE</h2>

<em>r.carve</em> does not create a depressionless DEM because many
depressions are in flat areas and not in the streams.


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=elevation.10m -p
r.carve rast=elevation.10m vect=streams out=carve_dem width=20 depth=5
</pre></div>

<h2>BUGS</h2>
<!-- Is this still the case as of Jan 11, 2008? - EP -->
The module does not operate yet in latitude-longitude locations.  It
has not been thoroughly tested, so not all options may work properly -
but this was the intention.
