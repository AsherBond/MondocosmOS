<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.volume</em> is a tool for summing cell values within clumps 
and calculating volumes and centroids of patches or clumps.
<p>
<em>r.volume</em> generates a table containing the sum of all cells from
a data_map layer sorted by category on a clump map, and optionally
generates a vector points map of the centroids for each clump.  If a
clump map is not specified, the current MASK is used.
The sum is multiplied by the area of a cell to give the volume
occupied by that cell.  See below for an example of the output
table. 

<!-- The table is placed in the user's home directory in the
file Gvol.report. (or not???)

NOTE: I can't find any evidence of this in the source code, and I have tested 
the module out as of Jan 10, 2008. I'll leave the above comment about
automatic report generation commented out from the manpage for now, unless I get 
notification otherwise. - EP

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>
If a clump map is not given and a MASK not set, the program exits
with an error message.
<p>
<em>r.volume</em> works in the current region and respects the current MASK.
<p>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

The following report was generated by the command:
(spearfish data base; fields.only is the fields layer without the
National Forest category)
<p>
r.volume data=elevation clump=fields.only centroids=field.centers 
<p>

The Data Total column is the sum of the elevations for each
in each of the fields.  The Total Volume is the sum multiplied
by the e-w resolution times the n-s resolution.  Note that
the units on the volume may be difficult if the units of cell
values on the data_map layer and the resolution units differ.
<p>

<h3>CENTROIDS</h3>
The centroid coordinates are the same as those stored in the sites
file (if one was requested).  They are guaranteed to fall on a cell
of the appropriate category, thus they are not always the true,
mathematical centroid.  They will always fall at a cell center.

<h3>FORMAT OF CENTROIDS table<br></h3>
For each line of above table the vector points table contains
these columns:
<tt>
easting,
northing,
cat,
volume,
average,
sum,
count
</tt>
<p>
This can be converted directly to a raster map with each point
a separate category using <em>v.to.rast</em>.

<!-- As far as I can tell, no attributes are written to a table in Grass 6.3
(Jan 2008), as this program hasn't been updated to use the Grass 6 vector library. - EP

<h3>APPLICATIONS</h3>
By preprocessing the elevation layer with <em>r.mapcalc</em> and using
suitable masking or clump maps, very interesting applications can
be done with <em>r.volume</em>.  Such as, calculating the volume of rock
in a potential quarry; calculating cut/fill volumes for roads;
finding water volumes in potential reservoirs.  Data layers of
other measures of real values.
