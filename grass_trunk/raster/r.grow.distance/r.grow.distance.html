<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>


<em>r.grow.distance</em> generates raster maps representing the
distance to the nearest non-null cell in the input map and/or the
value of the nearest non-null cell.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
The user has the option of specifying four different metrics which
control the geometry in which grown cells are created, (controlled by
the <b>metric</b> parameter): <i>Euclidean</i>, <i>Squared</i>,
<i>Manhattan</i>, and <i>Maximum</i>.

<p>

The <i>Euclidean distance</i> or <i>Euclidean metric</i> is the "ordinary" distance 
between two points that one would measure with a ruler, which can be 
proven by repeated application of the Pythagorean theorem. 
The formula is given by: 

<div class="code"><pre>d(dx,dy) = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2)</pre></div>

Cells grown using this metric would form isolines of distance that are
circular from a given point, with the distance given by the <b>radius</b>.

<p>
The <i>Squared</i> metric is the <i>Euclidean</i> distance squared,
i.e. it simply omits the square-root calculation. This may be faster,
and is sufficient if only relative values are required.

<p>

The <i>Manhattan metric</i>, or <i>Taxicab geometry</i>, is a form of geometry in 
which the usual metric of Euclidean geometry is replaced by a new 
metric in which the distance between two points is the sum of the (absolute) 
differences of their coordinates. The name alludes to the grid layout of 
most streets on the island of Manhattan, which causes the shortest path a 
car could take between two points in the city to have length equal to the
points' distance in taxicab geometry.
The formula is given by:

<div class="code"><pre>d(dx,dy) = abs(dx) + abs(dy)</pre></div>

where cells grown using this metric would form isolines of distance that are
rhombus-shaped from a given point. 

<p>

The <i>Maximum metric</i> is given by the formula

<div class="code"><pre>d(dx,dy) = max(abs(dx),abs(dy))</pre></div>

where the isolines of distance from a point are squares.


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Spearfish sample dataset
<div class="code"><pre>
r.grow.distance in=roads dist=dist_from_roads
</pre></div>
