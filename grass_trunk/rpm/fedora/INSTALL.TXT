To install GRASS, you will likely also need to install the following
RPMS:

- fftw-2.1.5-5.i386.rpm (version >= 2.1) available at
http://www.rpmfind.net (I believe it is also part of Fedora 3 Extras
for i386).

and the following, all available at
http://mappinghacks.com/rpm/fedora/3/

- gdal-1.2.5-mh3.i686.rpm
- proj-4.4.9-mh2.i686.rpm
- geos-2.1.1-mh2.i686.rpm
- ogdi-3.1.1-mh1.i686.rpm


The gdal package does require a number of libraries included with
PostreSQL.  Perhaps the easiest way to satisfy these requirements is
to add the application PostgreSQL via Add/Remove Applications under
the Applications->System Settings menu. The GRASS RPM is compiled with
full database support for ODBC, MYSQL and PostgreSQL; however, to use
these databases with GRASS they will need to be installed on your
system. MySQL can be installed using Add/Remove Applications as well.
Note that fully installing PostgreSQL requires further setup beyond
that done by via the automated Add/Removing Applications. See the
PostgreSQL website for instructions. This is only necessary if you
want to use PostgreSQL with GRASS.
