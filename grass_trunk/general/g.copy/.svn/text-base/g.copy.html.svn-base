<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

A user may access data stored under the other mapsets
listed in his mapset search path.  However, the user may
only modify data stored under his own current mapset.
<em>g.copy</em> allows the user to copy existing data files
<em>from</em> other mapsets <em>to</em> the user's current
mapset ($MAPSET).  The files to be copied must exist in the
user's current mapset search path and location; output is
sent to the relevant data element directory(ies) under the
user's current mapset.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

If the user wished to copy the existing raster
file <em>soils</em> to a file called <em>soils.ph</em> and
to copy an existing vector map <em>roads</em> to a file
called <em>rds.old</em>, the user could type:

<p>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.copy rast=soils,soils.ph vect=roads,rds.old
</pre></div>

<p>

Data files can also be specified by their mapsets.  For
example, the below command copies the raster map named
<em>soils</em> from the mapset <em>wilson</em> to a new
file called <em>soils</em> to be placed under the user's
current mapset:

<p>

<div class="code"><pre>
g.copy rast='soils@wilson',soils
</pre></div>

<p>

If no mapset name is specified, <em>g.copy</em> searches
for the named <em>from</em> map in each of the mapset
directories listed in the user's current mapset search path
in the order in which mapsets are listed there (see 

<em><a href="g.mapsets.html">g.mapsets</a></em>).

<h2>NOTES</h2>

If the user does not enter parameter values but instead
types only <b>g.copy</b> on the command line the program
will prompt the user for a data type, the name of a file of
this data type to copy, and the name of a new file to hold
the copy.  After both file names have been entered, the
copy is created and the user is again prompted for a data
element to be copied, until the user hits RETURN.  When
prompted for file names, the user may enter 'list' to see a
list of existing files, or hit RETURN to end the file
listing.

<p>

If a file has support files (e.g., as do raster data
files), these support files will also be copied.
