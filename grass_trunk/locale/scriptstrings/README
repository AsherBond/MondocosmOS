This is for translation of all the g.parser options of scripts.

This folder will be filled with strings extracted from scripts by running
g.parser -t <scriptfile>
The strings are converted into xgettext c style macros when they are extracted
as an intermidate step to convert them into .po files. The rules for making the regular module domain, grassmods, pick these up.

The rules for making these files are in include/Make/Script.make.
