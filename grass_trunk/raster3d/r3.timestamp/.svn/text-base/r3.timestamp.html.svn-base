<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This command has 2 modes of operation. If no date argument
is supplied, then the current timestamp for the 3D raster map
is printed. If a date argument is specified, then the
timestamp for the 3D raster map is set to the specified
date(s). See EXAMPLES below.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<b>r3.timestamp map=soils</b><br>
	  Prints the timestamp for the "soils" 3D raster map. If
	  there is no timestamp for soils, nothing is printed. If
	  there is a timestamp, one or two lines are printed,
	  depending on if the timestamp for the map consists of a
	  single date or two dates (ie start and end dates).
<p>
<b>r3.timestamp map=soils date='15 sep 1987'</b><br>
	  Sets the timestamp for "soils" to the single date<br>
	  "15 sep 1987"
<p>
<b>r3.timestamp map=soils date='15 sep 1987/20 feb 1988'</b><br>
	  Sets the timestamp for "soils" to have the start date<br>
	  "15 sep 1987" and the end date "20 feb 1988"
<p>
<b>r3.timestamp map=soils date='18 feb 2005 10:30:00/20 jul 2007 20:30:00'</b><br>
	  Sets the timestamp for "soils" to have the start date<br>
	  "18 aug 2005 10:30:00" and the end date "20 jul 2007 20:30:00"
<p>

<b>r3.timestamp map=soils date=none</b><br>
	  Removes the timestamp for the "soils" 3D raster map

<h2>TIMESTAMP FORMAT</h2>
     The timestamp values must use the format as described in the
     GRASS datetime library.  The source tree for this library
     should have a description of the format. For convience, the
     formats as of Feb, 1996 are reproduced here:
<p>
     There are two types of datetime values: absolute and
     relative. Absolute values specify exact dates and/or times.
     Relative values specify a span of time. Some examples will
     help clarify:
<p>
<b>Absolute</b><p>
	  The general format for absolute values is
<p><tt>
	     day month year [bc] hour:minute:seconds timezone
<br>
	     day is 1-31<br>
	     month is jan,feb,...,dec<br>
	     year is 4 digit year<br>
	     [bc] if present, indicates dates is BC<br>
	     hour is 0-23 (24 hour clock)<br>
	     mintue is 0-59<br>
	     second is 0-59.9999 (fractions of second allowed)<br>
	     timezone is +hhmm or -hhmm (eg, -0600)<br>
<br>
	  parts can be missing
<br>
	     1994 [bc]<br>
	     Jan 1994 [bc]<br>
	     15 jan 1000 [bc]<br>
	     15 jan 1994 [bc] 10 [+0000]<br>
	     15 jan 1994 [bc] 10:00 [+0100]<br>
	     15 jan 1994 [bc] 10:00:23.34 [-0500]<br>
<br>
</tt>
    <b> Relative</b>
	  There are two types of relative datetime values, year-
	  month and day-second.	 The formats are:
<p><tt>
	     [-] # years # months<br>
	     [-] # days # hours # minutes # seconds
</tt><p>
	  The words years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds
	  are literal words, and the # are the numeric values.<br>
	  Examples:<p>
<tt>
	     2 years<br>
	     5 months<br>
	     2 years 5 months<br>
	     100 days<br>
	     15 hours 25 minutes 35.34 seconds<br>
	     100 days 25 minutes<br>
	     1000 hours 35.34 seconds
</tt><p>
	  The following are <i>illegal</i> because it mixes year-month
	  and day-second (because the number of days in a month
	  or in a year vary):<p>
<tt>
	     3 months 15 days<br>
	     3 years 10 days
</tt>

<h2>BUGS</h2>
Spaces in the timestamp value are required.
