>From grass64/TODO:

  A)
    - lib/imagery/: standard lib, in use (i.* except for i.points3, i.rectify3)
    - imagery/i.ortho.photo/libes/: standard lib, in use (i.ortho.photo, photo.*)
  B)
    - lib/image3/: never finished improvement which integrated the standard lib and
                   the ortho lib. Seems to provide also ortho rectification for
                   satellite data (i.points3, i.rectify3)

Possibly a lot is already done in lib/image3/ ?
