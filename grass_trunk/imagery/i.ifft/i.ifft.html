<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>


<em>i.ifft</em> is an image processing program based on the algorithm given
by Frigo et al. (1998), that converts real and imaginary frequency space
images (produced by
<em><a href="i.fft.html">i.fft</A></em>) into a normal image.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The current mask is respected when reading the real and
imaginary component files;  thus, creating a mask is a 
primary step for
selecting the portion of the frequency space data to be included in the
inverse transform.  The GRASS program <em>r.digit</em> can be used to create
masks while viewing the real or imaginary component image. Alternatively
<em>r.circle</em> can be used to generate high-, low- and donut filters
specifying the DC point as circle/ring center.
When <em>i.ifft</em> is executed, it (automatically) uses the same GRASS
region definition setting that was used during the original transformation
done with <em><a href="i.fft.html">i.fft</A></em>.

dimensions, of both real and complex data, and of arbitrary input size.
