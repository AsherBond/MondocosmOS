"Pressing BSelect (Button 1) selects it and deselects any other selected item. \012\
Dragging BSelect or pressing and dragging BExtend (Shift + Button1) following \012\
a BSelect action selects all items between the item under the pointer and the \012\
item on which BSelect was pressed. This action also deselects any other \012\
selected items out side that range. Extended Select also allows the user to \012\
select and deselect discontiguous ranges of items.  Pressing BToggle (Control \012\
+ Button 1) on an item toggles its selection state but does not deselect any \012\
other selected items.  Dragging BToggle or pressing or dragging BExtend \012\
following a BToggle action sets the selection state of all items between \012\
the item under the pointer and the item on which BToggle was pressed to the \012\
state of the item on which BToggle was pressed.  This action does not deselect \012\
any other selected items outside that range."
