This directory contains an extension to Tcl/Tk (called BWidget) that provides
new and enhanced widgets. It is not a new interpreter but simply Tcl/Tk files
that provide the functionality. Therefore, there is nothing to compile and it
only requires 2 lines of code in your Tcl/Tk script to use the new widgets.
Some of the new widgets include

    On mouse over help balloons
    Tabbed notebook panes - like worksheets in Excel
    Directory tree listing
    Combination box or drop down option list
    Progress bar
    Many others

For a demonstration of the new widgets available perform the following

    cd demo
    wish demo.tcl
    
It may take some time to load, but it demonstrates all or most of the new
features.

To use these widgets with GRASS Tcl/Tk scripts (including tcltkgrass) then add
the following two lines to your main Tcl/Tk script

    lappend auto_path $env(GISBASE)/bwidget
    package require BWidget

Then simply use the new widgets as if they were already part of Tcl/Tk. To find
out more information on using the new widgets see the manual pages in
./BWman/index.html

For more information on BWidget see their home page at
