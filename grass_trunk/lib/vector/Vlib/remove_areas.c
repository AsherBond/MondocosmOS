   \brief Remove small areas from the map map.

   Centroid of the area and the longest boundary with adjacent area is
   removed.  Map topology must be built GV_BUILD_CENTROIDS.

   \param[in,out] Map vector map
   \param thresh maximum area size for removed areas
   \param[out] Err vector map where removed lines and centroids are written
   \param removed_area  pointer to where total size of removed area is stored or NULL

   \return number of removed areas
