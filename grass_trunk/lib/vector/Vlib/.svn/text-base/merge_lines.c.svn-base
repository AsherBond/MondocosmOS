/*!
   \brief Merge lines or boundaries in vector map.

   Merges lines specified by type in vector map.
   Useful for generalization and smoothing.
   Adjacent boundaries are merged as long as topology is maintained.
   Adjacent lines are merged as long as there are exactly two different 
   lines connected at a given node.
   Categories are added up when merging.
   GV_BUILD_BASE as topo build level is sufficient, areas need not be built.

   \param Map input vector map 
   \param type feature type
   \param[out] Err vector map where merged lines/boundaries will be written or NULL
   \param new_lines  pointer to where number of new lines/boundaries is stored or NULL

   \return number of merged lines/boundaries
