   \brief Remove duplicate features from vector map.

   Remove duplicate lines of given types from vector map. Duplicate
   lines may be optionally written to error map. Input map must be
   opened on level 2 for update. Categories are merged.
   GV_BUILD_BASE is sufficient.

   \param[in,out] Map vector map where duplicate lines will be deleted
   \param type type of line to be delete
   \param[out] Err vector map where duplicate lines will be written or NULL
