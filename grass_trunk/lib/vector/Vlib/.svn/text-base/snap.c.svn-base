  \brief Snap selected lines to existing vertex in threshold.
  
  Snap selected lines to existing vertices.
  
  \warning Lines are not necessarily snapped to nearest vertex, but to vertex in threshold! 
  
  Lines showing how vertices were snapped may be optionally written to error map. 
  Input map must be opened on level 2 for update at least on GV_BUILD_BASE.
  
  As mentioned above, lines are not necessarily snapped to nearest vertex! For example:
  <pre>
   |                    
   | 1         line 3 is snapped to line 1,
   |           then line 2 is not snapped to common node at lines 1 and 3,
   because it is already outside of threshold
   ----------- 3   

   |
   | 2
   |    
   </pre>
   
   The algorithm selects anchor vertices and snaps non-anchor vertices
   to these anchors.
   The distance between anchor vertices is always > threshold.
   If there is more than one anchor vertex within threshold around a
   non-anchor vertex, this vertex is snapped to the nearest anchor
   vertex within threshold.

   \param Map input map where vertices will be snapped
   \param List_lines list of lines to snap
   \param thresh threshold in which snap vertices
   \param[out] Err vector map where lines representing snap are written or NULL
   
   \return void
