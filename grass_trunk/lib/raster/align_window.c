/*!
 * \brief Align two regions.
 *
 * Modifies the input <i>window</i> to align to <i>ref</i> region. The
 * resolutions in <i>window</i> are set to match those in <i>ref</i>
 * and the <i>window</i> edges (north, south, east, west) are modified
 * to align with the grid of the <i>ref</i> region.
 *
 * The <i>window</i> may be enlarged if necessary to achieve the
 * alignment.  The north is rounded northward, the south southward,
 * the east eastward and the west westward. Lon-lon constraints are
 * taken into consideration to make sure that the north doesn't go
 * above 90 degrees (for lat/lon) or that the east does "wrap" past
 * the west, etc.
 *
 * \param[in,out] window pointer to Cell_head to be modified
 * \param ref pointer to Cell_head
 *
 * \return NULL on success
