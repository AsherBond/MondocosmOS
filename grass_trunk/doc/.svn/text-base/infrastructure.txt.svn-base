== GRASS Web server ==

Maintainer: M. Neteler

* http://grass.osgeo.org
** Shared virtual OSGeo machine hosted at Oregon State University Open Source Lab
   (server: projects.osgeo.osuosl.org)
** OSGeo SAC page: http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/SAC_Service_Status
    http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/SAC
** Login: via OSGeo LDAP, there is a "grass" LDAP group
** Software:
*** OS: Debian Lenny
*** Apache Server with PHP
** Further addresses: http://www.grass-gis.org
*** points through Apache rewrite engine to http://grass.osgeo.org

* Backup:
** VERIFY 2010: grass.osgeo.org is backup'ed via rsync to XXXX: http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/SAC:Backups#download.osgeo.org
** Wiki backup, via rsync to http://josef.fsv.cvut.cz/WIKI/grass-osgeo/index.php/Main_Page

* Web pages:
** hosted in SVN server (developers can modify, see
   http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/wiki/WebPagesManagement),
   downloaded to Web server via cronjob hourly
** written in simple PHP/HTML (just include() statement for menus)
** mirrored to selected tier-1 sites via rsync (hardcoded IPs to avoid
   that too many sites connect at grass.osgeo.org)
** tier-1 sites are mirrored via rsync to tier-2 mirrors (no hardcoded IPs)
** RSS feed: rss.xml file stored in SVN-Web
** TODO: To be migrated to CMS or whatever: http://grass.osgeo.org/wiki/Web_site

* i18N translation statistics (http://grass.osgeo.org/devel/i18n.php#statistics)
** based in Linux weekly snapshot
** GRASS version is coded in devel/i18n_stats.inc

* Weekly snapshots (generated Saturday morning California time):
** Source code tarball of SVN HEAD
** Linux binary snapshot is compiled
*** GRASS is compiled with GDAL, PROJ, SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, FFTW, C++ support
*** binary tar.gz is moved into Web space

* GRASS user manual HTML:
** generated during compilation of weekly Linux binary snapshot

* GRASS programmer's manual (http://grass.osgeo.org/programming7/)
** HTML: cronjob run Saturday morning California time
** disabled: PDF: cronjob run Saturday morning California time

* i18N translation statistics:
** generated during compilation of Linux binary snapshot, stats of
   (cd locale; make) are extracted into text file
** text file parsed by PHP page and shown as table

* GRASS user map
** GDF server is creating PNG output via Mapserver
** fetched every three hours via cronjob from http://mapserver.gdf-hannover.de/tmp/

* GRASS-Mapserver demo
** currently broken after grass.osgeo.org update

* Search engine (TODO!!)
** htdig runs once a week
** searchgrass.inc contains selective entries (SVN-Web)
** TODO: To be migrated to OSGeo server 12/2007

* FTP server
** no longer available due to security risk

* Mailman mailing lists + greylisting (at lists.osgeo.org since 11/2007)
** Mailman is doing the job, only registered users can post
** messages from unsubscribed people is auto-discarded without notification
** the open "weblist" operates instead like this:
    User -> grass-web at lists osgeo.org -> greylisting -> Mailman

* Backup of mailing lists (mbox files) (TODO!!)
** manually done by MN and Intevation (into freegis.org FTP space)
** nightly backup at OSGeo.org
** TODO: Establish solution via local cp on lists.osgeo.org (SAC ticket todo)

* Web statistics
** See URL at http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Project_Stats
** OSGeo: awstats (http://grass.osgeo.org/logs-bin/awstats.pl?config=grass.osgeo.org)
*** configuration at: /etc/awstats/awstats.grass.osgeo.org.conf
***                   /etc/httpd/conf.d/sites/grass.osgeo.org.conf
*** httpd logs: /var/log/httpd/grass_*
*** awstats processed log files: /osgeo/download/logs
*** cronjob script: /osgeo/scripts/update_logs.sh
** FBK Mirror: Webalizer (http://grass.fbk.eu/webalizer/) runs daily as cronjob
** Sitemeter: http://www.sitemeter.com/?a=stats&s=s24grassgis

Summary: The system should run almost autonomously.
